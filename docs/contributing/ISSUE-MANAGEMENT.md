# Issue Management Guidelines

## Purpose

This document defines the process for creating and managing issues in CassandraGargoyle projects that have GitHub repositories. It covers two primary
workflows for issue creation and ensures proper synchronization between internal team discussions and public GitHub tracking.

## Issue Creation Models

### Model A: Dual-Track Issue Management (Recommended for Portunix)

**When to use**: For projects requiring both internal planning and public transparency while maintaining security and privacy control.

**Overview**: This model maintains separate internal and public issue tracks with controlled synchronization.

#### Internal Issues (`docs/issues/internal/`)

- **Purpose**: Detailed technical planning, sensitive information, team discussions
- **Numbering**: Sequential `001-feature.md`, `002-bug.md`, etc.
- **Location**: `docs/issues/internal/XXX-title.md`
- **Tracking**: Updated in `docs/issues/README.md`
- **Content**: Can include:
  - Sensitive technical details
  - Internal architecture decisions
  - Resource allocation discussions
  - Private customer/security information
  - Detailed implementation plans

#### Public GitHub Issues

- **Purpose**: Community engagement, public roadmap, external contributions
- **Numbering**: GitHub automatic (#1, #2, #3...)
- **Content**: Sanitized version of internal issues
- **Visibility**: Full public access

#### Issue Mapping (`docs/issues/public/mapping.json`)

```json
{
  "description": "Mapping between internal issue numbers and public GitHub issue numbers",
  "mappings": {
    "PUB-001": {
      "internal": "001",
      "github_number": 1,
      "title": "Cross-Platform OS Detection System",
      "type": "feature",
      "status": "closed",
      "published": true,
      "milestone": "v1.5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Workflow Process

1. **Create Internal Issue**

   ```bash
   # Create docs/issues/internal/018-new-feature.md
   # Update docs/issues/README.md with status
   ```

2. **Team Review & Planning**
   - Technical discussion in internal issue
   - Architecture decisions documented
   - Implementation strategy defined

3. **Decide on Publication**
   - Evaluate if issue should be public
   - Sanitize content if needed
   - Create GitHub issue with public-appropriate description

4. **Update Mapping**

   ```json
   "PUB-018": {
     "internal": "018", 
     "github_number": 18,
     "title": "New Feature Implementation",
     "type": "feature",
     "status": "open",
     "published": true
   }
   ```

5. **Synchronize Updates**
   - Keep both tracks updated during development
   - Close both when resolved
   - Update mapping status accordingly

#### Internal Issue Template

```markdown
# [Internal] Feature Title

**Status**: Planning | Development | Testing | Complete
**Priority**: Low | Medium | High | Critical
**Assigned**: Team Member
**GitHub Issue**: #18 (if published)

## Internal Context
[Sensitive information, detailed technical notes, resource planning]

## Technical Implementation
[Detailed architecture, security considerations, performance notes]

## Team Notes
[Internal discussions, decisions, concerns]

## Public Summary
[What can be shared publicly - use for GitHub issue creation]
```

**Benefits of Dual-Track Model**:

- **Security**: Sensitive info stays internal
- **Transparency**: Public roadmap visible to community  
- **Flexibility**: Not all internal planning needs to be public
- **Traceability**: Clear mapping between internal and public discussions
- **Team Efficiency**: Internal discussions without public noise

### Model B: GitHub-First Issue Creation  

**When to use**: For bugs, feature requests, or issues that can be discussed publicly from the start and don't require internal planning.

**Process**:

1. **Create GitHub Issue**

   - Go to the project's GitHub repository
   - Click "Issues" → "New issue"
   - Choose appropriate template (Bug Report, Feature Request, etc.)
   - Fill in all required fields:
     - Clear, descriptive title
     - Detailed description
     - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
     - Expected vs actual behavior
     - Environment details
     - Labels (bug, enhancement, question, etc.)
     - Assign to milestone if applicable

2. **Reference in Team Communication**
   - Share GitHub issue link in team channels
   - Use issue number in commits: `Fix authentication bug (closes #42)`
   - Reference in pull requests: `Fixes #42`

3. **Track Progress**
   - Update issue status as work progresses
   - Add comments for significant updates
   - Close when resolved with summary

**Example GitHub Issue Creation**:

```text
Title: PowerShell installation fails on Fedora 40

Description:
## Bug Report

**Environment:**
- OS: Fedora 40
- Portunix version: 1.2.3
- Installation method: portunix install powershell --variant fedora

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run `portunix install powershell --variant fedora`
2. Wait for installation to complete

**Expected behavior:**
PowerShell should install successfully and be available via `pwsh` command

**Actual behavior:**
Installation fails with error: "Package powershell-fedora not found"

**Additional context:**
This worked on Fedora 39 but fails on Fedora 40. May be related to repository changes.

Labels: bug, powershell, fedora
Milestone: v1.3.0
```

### Model C: Team-First Issue Creation (Legacy)

**When to use**: For sensitive issues, internal planning, or when initial discussion is needed before public visibility.

**Note**: For Portunix project, prefer Model A (Dual-Track) which provides better structure and traceability.

**Process**:

1. **Internal Team Discussion**
   - Discuss the issue in team channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)
   - Gather initial requirements and scope
   - Determine if issue should be public or remain internal
   - Assign team member initials for tracking

2. **Create GitHub Issue**
   - Once ready for implementation, create public GitHub issue
   - Reference internal discussion: "Based on team discussion from [date]"
   - Include refined requirements and scope
   - Add appropriate labels and assignments

3. **Synchronize Tracking**
   - Link GitHub issue number to internal tracking
   - Use consistent numbering: "Issue #42 from GitHub corresponds to internal SD-042"
   - Update both systems as work progresses

**Example Team-First Workflow**:

```text
Internal Discussion:
Team Member 1: "We need better error handling for container failures"
Team Member 2: "Yes, and we should add retry logic"
Team Lead: "Let's create GitHub issue #43 for this enhancement"

GitHub Issue Creation:
Title: Improve container failure handling with retry logic

Description:
## Enhancement Request

Based on team analysis, we need to improve how Portunix handles container failures.

**Current behavior:**
- Container failures cause immediate termination
- No retry mechanism for transient failures
- Limited error information provided to user

**Proposed enhancement:**
- Add configurable retry logic (3 attempts by default)
- Implement exponential backoff between retries
- Provide detailed error messages with troubleshooting hints
- Log failure details for debugging

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Retry mechanism with configurable attempts
- [ ] Exponential backoff implementation
- [ ] Enhanced error messages
- [ ] Unit tests for retry logic
- [ ] Integration tests with container failures

Labels: enhancement, containers, error-handling
Milestone: v1.4.0
Assignee: developer-username
```
